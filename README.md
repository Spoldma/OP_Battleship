# OP_Battleship
"COOLEST"

Game made using object-oriented Java

Programmers - Sander PÃµldma, Gerdo Germann

Based on the popular board and online game "Battleship", this version is created by two students at Tartu University. Instead of "unit like" ships, 
this game implements "mine" like elements as ships. The enemy is your computer.
At the start of the game you have to choose the dimension of your gameboard and the number of ships on it. Blow up your enemy's ships first and you win. 
Have a try yourself and let us know where to improve!
